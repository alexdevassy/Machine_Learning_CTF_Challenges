# Mirage CTF Challenge 

## 🎯 Challenge Overview

### Scenario

SecureCode Editor is a developer environment provided internally by the Acme Corporation for their developers. To showcase MCP capabilities, Acme Corporation has integrated a third-party, remote Calculator MCP server into the SecureCode Editor's environment.

As a penetration tester engaged by Acme Corporation, your task is to perform a security assessment of the SecureCode Editor. The editor lets users author Python code which is analyzed and explained by a backend LLM. Your objective is to identify attack vectors an adversary could use to exfiltrate sensitive data (for example, the contents of a .env file) to an attacker-controlled server.

Flag Format: Flag:{\<FLAG\>}

## Rules 📐 & Clues 🧐

Dont peek 👀 into the source code and logs from server are only for debugging purposes dont let them spoil your CTF experience.

* .env and prompt space are locked in UI intentionally. 
* Remember flag is only revealed if data like .env is exfiltrated to attacker controlled server.
