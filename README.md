# Machine Learning CTF Challenges

As the realms of artificial intelligence and machine learning continue to shape our world :earth_asia:, the imperative to assess their influence on cybersecurity intensifies. While many AI/ML breakthroughs in cybersecurity revolve around defense and threat intelligence, such as intelligent :computer: SIEM systems and AI-driven malware detection, an intriguing question arises: "Can researchers harness AI/ML for offensive security, or can they outmaneuver AI/ML algorithms with innovative cybersecurity approaches?" This presents a captivating new horizon in the domain of offensive security.üöÄ

Within this repository lie an array of engaging CTF (Capture The Flag :triangular_flag_on_post:) challenges meticulously crafted for applications which leverage machine learning algorithms in their backend. The intent of this repository to emphasize the need for implementation of security measures within machine learning applications, safeguarding üõ°Ô∏è them against the ever-evolving threat landscape. It serves as a guiding beacon in fortifying the convergence of technology and securityüîí.
