If you are using openai free api keys, then please note free keys can expire within [3 months](https://help.openai.com/en/articles/4936830-what-happens-after-i-use-my-free-tokens-or-the-3-months-is-up-in-the-free-trial). 

:hand: :exclamation: :exclamation: ***Step 2 can be either building the docker image of application (Step2a) OR setting up the application in local machine (Step2b).*** :no_entry_sign:

##### :point_right: Step 2a - Building Docker Image of the Application To Host The Challenge

`cd Machine_Learning_CTF_Challenges/Dolos_ML_CTF_Challenge/`

`docker build -t dolos_ml_ctf .`

To run the challenge `docker run --rm -p 5000:5000 -ti dolos_ml_ctf --rebuffkey="<REBUFF_API_KEY>" --openaikey="<OPENAI_API_KEY>"`

### OR

##### :point_right: Step 2b - Setting Up Python Flask App To Host The Challenge

The challenge works best in `Ubuntu` systems with `Python 3.8.10`

Create virtual enviornment in python using `python -m venv virtualspace`

Activate the virtual enviornemnt `source /virtualspace/bin/activate`

`git clone https://github.com/alexdevassy/Machine_Learning_CTF_Challenges.git`

`cd Machine_Learning_CTF_Challenges/Dolos_ML_CTF_Challenge/`

`pip install -r .\requirements.txt` 

`python3 app.py --rebuffkey="<REBUFF_API_KEY>" --openaikey="<OPENAI_API_KEY>"`

Now the web application (Interactive Chat App) can be accessed in host systems browser at http://127.0.0.1:5000/
